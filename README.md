# VirGL-Overlay-Rebuild Mod Retangle Fix

VirGL Overlay is used with Mesa to get GPU acceleration, typically in Exagear Windows Emulator for Android. <br />
Fork based on version 0.0.8 created to fix the black retangle bug where the overlay is not resized in some games when using vtest_win staying in front of the game, then i changed the application start and included some help text.<br>
To fix the bug, checkbox ""Disable Resize Overlay" must be activated 




Application based on Mittorn port of virglrenderer for Android:<br />
